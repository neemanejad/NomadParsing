## Purpose of Branch
* Create ease of program use and access for users by adding command line arguments and eliminating user input
  during runtime.

## Goals With This Branch
* Transitioning NomadParse from acquiring user input during runtime to obtaining all user input in the command line,
  eventaully input from a text file given by the user. 
* Implementing a guide on how to use the program throughout the addition of more command line arguments.
* Adding command line arguments for the html elements within the URL source code so NomadParse.py can be usable for any
  website.
